    "Eigenvalues: In the context of linear transformations, an eigenvalue is a scalar value that represents how the transformation stretches or compresses a particular eigenvector. When a matrix is multiplied by its corresponding eigenvector, the result is a scaled version of the eigenvector, and the scaling factor is the eigenvalue. Eigenvalues are crucial in understanding how a matrix behaves under transformations.\n",

    "Geometric Interpretation in 3D:\n",
    "In three-dimensional space, eigenvectors can represent axes of rotation, stretching, or shearing. Each eigenvector corresponds to a direction that remains unchanged (or is scaled by a factor) during the transformation, and the corresponding eigenvalue indicates the scale factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, eigenvectors and eigenvalues provide a geometric understanding of how matrices transform space. Eigenvectors point along special directions that are scaled or remain unchanged, and eigenvalues quantify the scaling factors along those directions. This interpretation is particularly useful in fields where understanding the geometric effects of transformations is essential, such as physics, computer graphics, and engineering.\n",
